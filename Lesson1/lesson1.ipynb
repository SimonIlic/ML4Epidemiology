    "This is a Jupyter Notebook. It is like a physical notebook with text and images, but it also runs python scripts. We are hosting this notebook in the cloud on Google Colab. Later, if you are using Machine Learning algorithms in your own research you will probably run python scripts locally on your own computer, or perhaps even a super-computer. For learning however a notebook can be useful. It allows us to provide helpful information besides all the code. Running it on Google Colab allows us to get started without any installation burdens on your local device.\n",
